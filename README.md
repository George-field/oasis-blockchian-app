### Things I would Do differently 

In totoal I have spent around 4 hours on this task, including research time. This is due to me being strapped for time but there are a lot of things that I would do differently. 

noteabley I would have ustilised the context api and created a global state that hanldes the storage of data & errors as
this would be a cleaner approach to handleing this. 

testing - I would have added test cases for the api

hooks - All custom hooks will go in here
lib - All external libaries/packages that I am utilising will live here.
interfaces - All interfaces go here
